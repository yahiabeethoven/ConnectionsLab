# Assignment 2 - *Capstone Timeline Visualization*

Submitted by: **Yahia Beethoven Tayel**

**Capstone Timeline Visualization** is a simple website that displays the 6 main milestones of my capstone project. At first, only the headlines (week numbers) of these steps are shown until the user hovers over any of them, after which all blocks expand horizontally and the text of the specific milestione on which the mouse was hovered on becomes visible. With each block the user hovers on, the text appears while expanding the box vertically. At the bottom of each milestone, there is a button with the text "Done" that the user can click when they are done reading the steps of the milestone. After clicking, the block changes from black to grey, the text changes momentarily to black to reassure the user the button was clicked successfully, and the button vanishes to indicate this milestone has been completed (similar to the logic of a to-do list). As the user clicks on each button and progresses, if all 6 are clicked, the header changes from white to green and its text from black to white to indicate the capstone project is finally done!

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## Progress

I designed one main wireframe for this project given its simple nature and direct approach.

I have some previous experience working with HTML and CSS so figuring out how to work with Flex boxes and other tags quickly was not challenging for me. However, it took me some trial and error and a bit of practice to refresh my memory and put together what each style attribute does exactly and how an HTML structure should look like. 

I want to explore text fonts further in the future because I believe they are central in designing webpages and keeping themes consistent. I also look forward to knowing how to best implement footer icons and social objects without tens of lines of code that you find online. Last and definitely not least, I look forward to building realistic pages with actual interactive functionalities using JavaScript in the future.
