            <h3 class="description-title">Take a fun quiz to know which character on the iconic FRIENDS sitcom you are most 
                similar to...</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Whenever an option is chosen, the choice color changes momentarily to indicate that choice. 
                I used 4 questions from a couple of websites to have an existing reference, 
                but I made up the remaining 7 questions on my own to make it more personal. The questions are initially very easy, 
                meaning that you can guess right away which answer represents which of the six characters. But 
                as you go further, the answers are less direct, which is  
                because the player is improving in answering the questions by time and to make it more interesting as if 
                the game is a realistic interactive test.
            </p>
            <h4 class="description-title">Implementation</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">I used the main theme song in the background at all times and the player can lower the 
                volume because it can be too repetitive. The frames of the options and in the instructions and the buttons 
                on the Arduino board all have the same pattern of colors in the same order (red, blue, yellow, red, yellow blue).
                 I used the same shade of purple and gold as in Monica’s apartment throughout the game. I also used the same font
                  as in the original series’ logo. The yellow bulb indicates that the game is waiting for you to choose an answer,
                   the blue blinks while you are pressing, and the green lights up when you finish the trivia. I made it so the 
                   instructions appear only during the first time you start the game and not if you replay because by then you 
                   surely know how to play. I made it so the choices change color if you hover over them using the mouse to make 
                   it more interactive.</p>
            <h4 class="description-title">Significance of this project</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">
                This project is very special for me because it’s centered around the first show I have ever watched and one 
                of my favorites ever. I have tried to encapsulate every aspect of the theme of the show into the project as 
                possible and the result is pretty satisfying.</p>
