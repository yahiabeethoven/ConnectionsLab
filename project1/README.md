# Project 1 - *African Football Awareness*

Submitted by: **Yahia Beethoven Tayel**

**African Football Awareness** is an interactive website that allows users to explore the teams participating in the Confederation of African Football (CAF)'s most prestigious club competition: the CAF Champions League in order to spread awareness about the underrated African football and cater to potential football fans.

## Motivation
I chose to build this project for several reasons. First, I am an avid football fan and I love watching games of multiple teams such as Al Ahly SC, FC Barcelona, and the French national team. Furthermore, designing a page that revolves around football and its statistics is very enjoyable for me. This specific topic has become relevant recently because national African leagues have become more significant globally and there has been a noticable surge in African players joining top European teams in England, Spain, and Italy. Therefore, both European and non-European fans alike would be interested in getting to know more about African football and how these African superstars came to be by exploring their beginnings. The words "Champions League" and "football" are recognizable by most, so I used them throughout the websote to help resonate with the audience.

## Process
For this project, I used the <a href="https://app.sportdataapi.com/">Sport Data API</a> to import the dataset containing all information related to football in Africa and the world. I first explored the API and what it can provide by printing out different objects within the JSON files that I called. I then decided on choosing African teams rather than European ones for the purpose of awareness, and tested which attributes can be accessed and how. I based my website design off of the CAF brand as shown, where I used the same color palette and font throughout the page. At first, I created a map mannually containing all team members and their IDs, but for optimization purposes and to allow the website to work if I chose a different season or tournament, I made all information based on fetch calls to the API. I also decided to not include too much information on the page so as to not overwhelm non-football fans and turn them off, and to make the web page load fast enough. Being able to display all the attributes that mattered to me without causing any errors or logical mistakes required me to account for countless edge cases and scenarios, especially given that the API was not complete in many parts. 

## Progress

I designed one main wireframe for this project given its simple nature and direct approach.

For this assignment, I wanted to create a very interactive timeline that takes you from the starting point all the way to the end point. The goal was to indicate to the user that they have "completed" a node after they read it somehow, and to smoothly transition between nodes. This was achieved, although not perfect because I would have liked to also gradually recolor the timeline vertical ruler along with the boxes to show progress, and I wanted to add more fun effects when the user is done going through all milestones such as a funny sound or some fireworks naimation across the screen. I could also ensure progress is saved in the future such that the web page is actually meaningful as a progress indicator. I could have also added some images to each milestone when it is hovered/clicked to elaborate on what exactly happened in that phase as documentation.

Overall, I think the assignment was quite manageable, and had significantly refreshed my memory when it comes to working with JavaScript and further with HTML and CSS, so I'm glad that I got to do this webpage!
