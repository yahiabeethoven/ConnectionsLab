# Class 1 Assignment 1 - *Previous Project Webpage*

Submitted by: **Yahia Beethoven Tayel**

**Previous Project Webpage** is a simple website that summarizes my final project in IM class Introduction to Interactive Media, It displays the main screen at the top and then shows a demo of the project alongside some descriptive text. 

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] an image
* [x] a video
* [x] p tag
* [x] headings
* [x] a tag

## Progress

I designed 2 main wireframes to showcase my project. 
The first one had a nice image occupying the whole width of the screen with a main focus on the video and text description.

<img src='./Wireframes/Wireframe Design 1.png' title='Wireframe 1' width='' alt='Wireframe 1' />

The second one was more focused on the actual images from the project that appear to the player when they complete the character quiz. Examples would be the specfic image of Chandler or Joey with their respective texts to immerse the user into the game. This version emphasizes these screenshots more than the demo or the text, but for the purposes of this assignment I believe simplicity and being direct is more valuable which is why I went with the first wireframe

<img src='./Wireframes/Wireframe Design 2.png' title='Wireframe 2' width='' alt='Wireframe 2' />

I have some previous experience working with HTML and CSS so figuring out how to work with Flex boxes and other tags quickly was not challenging for me. However, it took me some trial and error and a bit of practice to refresh my memory and put together what each style attribute does exactly and how an HTML structure should look like. 

I want to explore text fonts further in the future because I believe they are central in designing webpages and keeping themes consistent. I also look forward to knowing how to best implement footer icons and social objects without tens of lines of code that you find online. Last and definitely not least, I look forward to building realistic pages with actual interactive functionalities using JavaScript in the future.
